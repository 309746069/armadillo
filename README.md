# Overview

* Fast C++ matrix library with easy to use functions and syntax, deliberately similar to Matlab. Uses template meta-programming techniques.

* Also provides efficient wrappers for LAPACK, BLAS and ATLAS libraries, including high-performance versions such as Intel MKL, AMD ACML and OpenBLAS.

* Useful for machine learning, pattern recognition, signal processing, bioinformatics, statistics, finance, etc.

# Features

* Easy to use
* Many MATLAB like functions
* Efficient classes for vectors, matrices, cubes (3rd order tensors) and fields
* Fast singular value decomposition (SVD), eigen decomposition, QR, LU, Cholesky, FFT
* Statistical modelling using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
* Clustering using K-means and Expectation Maximisation
* Automatic vectorisation of expressions (SIMD)
* Contiguous and non-contiguous submatrices
* Automatically combines several operations into one
* Useful for prototyping directly in C++
* Useful for conversion of research code into production environments
